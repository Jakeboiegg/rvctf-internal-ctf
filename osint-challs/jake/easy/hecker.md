RVCTF intelligence has given us intel that there is a suspected attack on RDEV servers. Now, I know we have our differences, and RVCTF is clearly the superior branch, but we have to help our brothers out. The attacker goes by the alias sigma_hecker_08, or so we are told. Go, capturer of flags, find out what mallice he is up to, and put an end to it once and for all!

flag: RVCTF{RDev_H4s_b33n_compR0m153D}
