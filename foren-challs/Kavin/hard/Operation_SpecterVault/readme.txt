Title: Operation SpecterVault
Description:
A notorious cybercrime syndicate has been siphoning funds using a remote-access Windows workstation dubbed “SpecterVault.”
You intercepted a raw memory dump after a suspected exfiltration.
Your mission: Analyze the memory image, recover any staged artefacts, and extract the full flag.

(Hint: The attackers obfuscated the flag with a simple XOR. Try brute-forcing common 1-byte XORs.)

Flag format: RVCTF{...}
Files: spectervault.mem
