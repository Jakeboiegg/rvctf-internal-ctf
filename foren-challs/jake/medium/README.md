Pop is watching skibidi toilet, and they got soooo engrossed that they forgot they had homework to do! Pop pops a red bull and locks in, and loads in their personalised homework website. OH NO!!! Pop forgot their username and password! It is currently 11:58:12 PM and the skibidi toilet has depleted them of their login details (their assignments are due at 11:59:59 PM)! they ask their friend who was just about to go to bed to rememeber for them, but the """friend""", being a dumb dumb, did not want to remember outright! It is currently 11:59:33 PM. They have 26 seconds left. Pop is COOKED. Pop tosses you their router, hoping their login details are still in there somehow. It is up to you, the capturer of flags, to cut through the skibidi brainrot, and complete the assignments before their teacher comes for them!

P.S. pcap file is slightly faked because coding is hard.
