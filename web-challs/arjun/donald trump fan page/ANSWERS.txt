Ideally the students shouldn't have access to the html file because it's a lot easier to find the flags that way.

Out of the three flag pieces (keys), one can be found directly on the page while the other two can only be found by inspecting the HTML code

Key #1
Pretty easy, found in the 'piece' attribute of a fake element above the <head> tag.
The key is RTk_nu

Key #2
This is the only one that can be found directly on the website, but it's slightly easier to find it by inspecting the HTML code.
In one of the long chunks of 'DONALD TRUMP' texts, one of the letters is slightly tinted blue.
By clicking on it, a javascript alert is triggered, displaying the second key on screen.
The key is VF1jgn

Key #3
One of the image sources is broken (fifth), because the final key is hidden in the middle of the 'src' attribute of it.
The key is C{m0_}

Combining the keys:
Each key only contains a part of the full flag. This is how to obtain the flag:
First char of first key + first char of second key + first char of third key +
Second char of first key + second char of second key + second char of third key + ...

By using this process to piece together the flag, you'll get: RVCTF{k1m_j0ng_un}
