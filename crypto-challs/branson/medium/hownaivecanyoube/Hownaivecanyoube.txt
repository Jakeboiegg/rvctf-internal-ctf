X: So...you did what to the plaintext??

Y: Well I thought since encryption made something more secure, I could just encrypt the encrypted result to make something even more secure! Then, I thought, what if i encrypt the double encrypted plaintext, then did it again and again! In the end, i encrypted it a total of 5 times

X: ...but you used encryption methods that could be brute-forced?

Y: Yep! I only know my way around base64, hex, Base32 and Base 85 :p

X: That does not really make it more secure...just more tedious to find

Y: Well, can you find it?

X: What is the resultant ciphertext?
